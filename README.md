HAR Project - Human Activity Recognition
ACM preinternship project 2023


Human activity recognition (HAR) using video cameras in video surveillance involves analyzing visual data to automatically detect and classify human activities. This approach leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to interpret the visual information captured by cameras. Key steps include extracting features from video frames, such as motion patterns, shapes, and spatial relationships, and using these features for activity classification. Common activities of interest include walking, running, loitering, and other behaviors relevant to security monitoring. HAR in video surveillance plays a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of surveillance systems by automating the process of identifying suspicious or abnormal activities, thereby assisting security personnel in real-time threat detection and response. This application is vital in public spaces, critical infrastructure, and other areas where monitoring and ensuring security are paramount concerns.

Pre-requisites:
  • python3
  • opencv
  • numpy

You need to dowwload a resnet-34_kinetics.onnx model from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/065l4vr8bptzohb/resnet-34_kinetics.onnx?dl=1) and once downloaded drop it inside the model directory of our project (shown in directory structure)
